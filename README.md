## Welcome to my Software Development class Github page
###### (I promise, while we were forced to make this, we are having fun nonetheless)

### Anyways, here we go:
#### First - Who Am I?:
- My name is **Lenin**, but I asure you that I am not a communist.
- Hobbies include -
    * Programming (of course)
    * Practicing guitar
    * gAmInG

#### Second - My Projects:
- RPSGame_Lenin.py
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Oqqay/SDClass/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Oqqay/SDClass/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
